The development of complex and scalable software systems has shifted from monolithic architectures towards the so called microservice architecture. This architectural pattern has evolved out of real world use cases of large internet corporations as a variant of the service-oriented architecture. First, this thesis provides a survey on the reasons behind this paradigm shift. Furthermore, different technologies for successfully implementing microservices are presented and evaluated. Among those technologies are containers for virtualization, serverless event-driven functions and the actor model. Based on the enumerated concepts this thesis provides recommendations to find appropriate applications for microservices and describes how to effectively apply this architectural style to complex software systems.
