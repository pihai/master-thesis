For the development of complex and scalable software systems there has been a shift from monolitic architecturs towards the so called Microservcie Architecture. This architectural pattern is a variant of the service-oriented architecture, which has evolved of real use cases of large internet corporations. First, this thesis provides a survey of the reasons behind this paradigm shift. Then different technologies for successfully implementing microservices are described and compared with each other. Among those technologies are container for virtualization, serverless event-driven functions and the actor model. On the basis of the enumerated concepts this thesis provides recommendations to find suited applications for microservices and describes how to successfully apply this pattern.
